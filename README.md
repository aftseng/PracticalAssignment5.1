For this assignment, the coupon groups that were explored were the Bar and Coffee House coupon groups.

In regards to the Bar coupon group, the main characteristics that were analzyed were: the frequency of which customers visited the bar, the age(s) of the customers, what kind of passengers were present, specific forms of martial status, income, and frequency of visiting other certain establishments. 
Based on the comparisons between various specifications of the attributes listed, here are the hypotheses that were created:
People who have visited the bar three times or less in a month had a higher chance of accepting the coupon that those who visited more often,
People at the age of 25 and below had a higher chance of accepting the coupon that those who are older,
and People with passengers that weren't children had a higher chance of accepting the coupon.

In regards to the Coffee House coupon group, the main characteristics that were analyzed were: frequency of which customers visited Coffee Houses, the age(s) of the customers, and what kind of passengers were present/absent.

People at the age of 25 and below had a higher chance of accepting the coupon that those who are older,
and people with passengers that children were more likely to accept the coupon.

Some next steps in analyzing the acceptance rates of coupons invovles covering more attributes. The provided analysis only touches on some of the provided attributes in the dataset, so going over other relevant attributes could provide more information. Additionally, it would be beneficial to analyze the other kinds of coupons. There were already some similarities in attributes between bar and coffee house coupons that lead to them being accepted, and analyzing the attributes of other kinds of coupons could provide additional similarities that would further help in determining what can lead to a person accepting a coupon.
